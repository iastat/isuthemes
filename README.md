# isuthemes
An R package containing themes, color schemes, and other stylistic elements for creating ISU-themed ggplot2 plots. (With apologies to Ricardo Bion and the ggtech package.)

This repo was forked from CSAFE-ISU/csafethemes and modified for ISU elements and colors. 

For the Univers Fonts: 

```{r}
# install.packages("extrafont")
library(extrafont)
font_import(pattern = 'Univers', prompt=FALSE)
```
